Ruby is very object-oriented. It means that everything in Ruby is an object
Strings need to be stored even if an existing string exists with same value. Symbols only are stored once

# Ruby Course — roadmap and repository overview

This repository is a compact, project-based Ruby course covering fundamental topics and small exercises. It's organized as a learning path you can follow: read the short notes, open the example files in each mini-project, run them, and modify them to experiment.

The course structure mirrors a typical curriculum and the projects listed below are implemented as small, focused scripts in this repo.

## Course structure (high level)

- Introduction: installing Ruby, editor tips, basic REPL usage
- Basic Ruby: basic data types, variables, I/O, conditional logic, loops, arrays, hashes, methods
- Basic Ruby Projects: Caesar Cipher, Sub Strings, Stock Picker, Bubble Sort
- Object Oriented Programming Basics: OOP concepts and projects (next module)
- Files and Serialization: reading/writing files, simple persistence projects
- Advanced Ruby: pattern matching, blocks, custom enumerables
- Testing with RSpec: TDD introduction and testing projects
- Computer Science basics: recursion, time/space complexity, data structures
# basic-ruby-projects

A compact, project-based Ruby course with small exercises organized under the `basic-ruby/` folder.

Repository layout

- `basic-ruby/`
  - `bubble-sort/`
  - `caesar-cipher/`
  - `stock-piper/`
  - `substrings/`

Each project folder contains a short README and an example script you can run.

Quick usage

From the repository root, run the example scripts under `basic-ruby/`:

```bash
ruby basic-ruby/caesar-cipher/caesar-cipher.rb
ruby basic-ruby/substrings/substrings.rb
ruby basic-ruby/stock-piper/stock-piper.rb
ruby basic-ruby/bubble-sort/bubble-sort.rb
```

Contributing

- Make a branch named `feature/<short-name>` for changes.
- Commit with clear messages and open a PR when ready.

If you'd like, I can also scaffold OOP starter folders (for example `tic-tac-toe/`) next.
