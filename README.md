# Ruby Course: roadmap and repository overview

This repository is a compact, project-based Ruby course covering fundamental topics and small exercises. It's organized as a learning path you can follow: read the short notes, open the example files in each mini-project, run them, and modify them to experiment.

The course structure mirrors a typical curriculum and the projects listed below are implemented as small, focused scripts in this repo.
