# Ruby Course: roadmap and repository overview

This repository is a compact, project-based Ruby course covering fundamental topics and small exercises. It's organized as a learning path you can follow: read the short notes, open the example files in each mini-project, run them, and modify them to experiment.

The course structure mirrors a typical curriculum and the projects listed below are implemented as small, focused scripts in this repo.

## Course structure

- Introduction: installing Ruby, editor tips, basic REPL usage
- Basic Ruby: basic data types, variables, I/O, conditional logic, loops, arrays, hashes, methods
- Object Oriented Programming Basics: OOP concepts and projects (next module)
- Files and Serialization: reading/writing files, simple persistence projects
- Advanced Ruby: pattern matching, blocks, custom enumerables
- Testing with RSpec: TDD introduction and testing projects
- Computer Science basics: recursion, time/space complexity, data structures

# Quick usage

From the repository root, run the example scripts:

```bash
ruby basic-ruby/project/project.rb
```
